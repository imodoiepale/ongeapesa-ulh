"""
Ongea Pesa — LiveKit voice agent worker.

Runs OUTSIDE the Next.js app (Vercel cannot host a long-lived media process).
Deploy to the Hostinger VPS with systemd; see README.md in this directory.

Design constraints this file is built around:

  * It is a PARALLEL runtime, not a replacement. ElevenLabs remains the default;
    a user only reaches this worker when an admin sets profiles.voice_engine to
    'livekit'. The money path must therefore behave identically.

  * Every money tool posts the SAME payload to the SAME endpoint the ElevenLabs
    agent uses (POST {APP_URL}/api/voice/webhook). The webhook owns fee
    calculation, the free-transaction rule, step-up staging and the n8n call.
    Nothing about pricing or authorisation is reimplemented here — if it were,
    the two engines would drift and one of them would be wrong.

  * Fish Audio supplies the voice (TTS). It does not solve Sheng comprehension —
    that is an ASR problem, addressed separately by fine-tuning Whisper on the
    corpus collected at /training. STT is behind a swappable factory below so
    that model can drop in without touching agent logic.

You speak naturally in English, Kiswahili and Sheng, matching whichever the user
uses. Keep replies short — this is spoken aloud, not read.

Rules that are not negotiable:
- NEVER invent a balance, a fee, or a transaction result. Only state what a tool
  returned to you.
- Always read back the amount and the recipient before sending, and wait for a
  clear yes.
- If the user is ambiguous about amount or recipient, ask. Do not guess.
- If a tool returns an agent_message, say that message. Do not paraphrase it.
- Never ask for a PIN or password out loud. Confirmation happens in the app.

Amounts are Kenyan shillings. "Soo" or "mia" is hundred, "elfu" is thousand,
"chwani"/"doo"/"ganji" all mean money in Sheng.
